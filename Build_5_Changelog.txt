* Cleaned up code in places to make simpler
* Rewrote system to support players not always being in a party
* If you leave your party because you become red you will no longer be put in another party and will simply be alone
* If you leave your party because your party was yellow and you remove a member of the party from your yellow list you will not be put in another party and will simply be alone.
* Added youJoinPlayer message
* Added joinPlayer message

Needs testing:
* Allow players to join other players who aren't in a party
* Added a new statusSetColorInNewPlayer message

TODO:
* Update status messages to have two different messages for party status; one in a party and one not in a party.
* remove the last player from their party when the second member of the party joins another one
* Update the leave party command
